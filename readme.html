<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p> What you see is a network visualization of the ontology of concepts presented in this wiki.
    In short, an ontology answers what kind of things exist in the wiki and what manner of relations those things can have to each other. </p>
<h2>What does it give?</h2>
<p> The visualization can be treated as a concept map of the wiki.
    Nodes are representing concepts, when edges give sense of the relations between them.
    For example, if you study an article in the wiki about some concept, you can easily check what concepts are related (and how) to the one you reading about.    </p>
<h2>How to use it?</h2>
<p>  Use pan, zoom and search to navigate to a concept of interest.
    Left click on a node representing a concept retrieves the wiki page explaining this concept.
    Use the right mouse button to drag the nodes and make them sticky.
    Mouseover highlights neighboring concepts and relation between them.
    Double click on a node allows centering the node.
    Have fun.
